## MY JOURNEY

Hey all, I'm currently going through the start of my adventures in coding. I'm hoping to turn this into a career, so I'm getting my feet in the door! This is the first of many practice lessons I've started challenging myself to complete. Eventually, I'll start creating my own independent projects that have my personal piece of flair to them instead of replicating from a lesson. Here's to a good future!
